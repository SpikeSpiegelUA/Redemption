# Redemption
Unreal Engine 5 RPG with a turn-based combat

Open the Source->Redemption folder to see the codebase. The entire codebase is written by me. The game was in development for approximately 2 years, from 2023 to 2024.

Main Features:
-Turn-based combat system, that calculates hit chances and damage based on resistances/skills/stats triada;
-Save system, that saves all the actors in the world, whether they were destroyed and quest stages;
-AI is based on the behavior trees;
-Dialogue system with a lot of room for scripting and branching dialogue. Dialogue system is based on behaviour trees;
-Inventory system with different types of items(range weapon, helmet, lower armor, melee weapon, restoration item, etc.);
-Ð¡omplex spell crafting system.
